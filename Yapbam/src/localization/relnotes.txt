	When selecting a shortcut to a folder in the drop down menu of a file selection dialog, under java 1.6, Yapbam hangs.<br/>In fact, this is not a Yapbam bug, but a <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do;jsessionid=518b010bce71d8547e0dfeee596a?bug_id=6550546">java1.6 bug</a>. The best way to fix the problem is use java 1.7.
improvement
	Yapbam is able to automatically save your data to a disk or a ftp server.
	When an operation pointed is duplicated, the statement is emptied (unless the autofill function is set in the preferences dialog. In such a case, this field is automatically filed).
fix
	When we validated the Preferences dialog, Yapbam restarted automatically, even when it was not necessary.
	The currency converter was not working when the selected language was German.

version	0.9.9 (01/02/2012)
improvement
	Yapbam is now also available in German (a big thank you to Jean-Ren&eacute; Thies).
	Adds a button "Generate periodic transactions" in the transactions table and in the "Periodical transactions" administration panel.
fix
	In the dialog for entering sub-transactions, we could validate an unlabeled sub-transaction by erasing the text and clicking quickly on the "Validate" button.
	When entering an incorrect value in the "Customized" field of the "Transaction editing" tab of the preferences dialog, we had time to click the "Submit" button before it becomes disabled.
	In some dialogs when clicking the "Validate" button during a date or amount field edition, the click did not closed the dialog.

version	0.9.8 (12/18/2011)
improvement
	When creating mass transactions the date is now kept when you click the next button.
fix
	Some imported file separators (eg \) were not supported. Using such a separator led to a crash of the import file dialog.
	Using account names, method of payment or categories that begin or end with spaces could cause crashes in the dialog for creating these objects.
	The icons and warning messages (when the threshold of balance is exceeded or when there are periodic transactions to generate) were sometimes displayed on the wrong tab.
	When selecting a shortcut (symbolic link) in a file selection dialog, Yapbam did not follow the link to read/save the target file, but directly read/saved the shortcut file.

version	0.9.7 (11/13/2011)
improvement
	It is now possible to display relative balances in the transactions tab (you have to click a balance to make it the reference for other balances).
	The components of the tab "operations" are rearranged. The buttons for creating / editing / deleting operations are now under the list, as in the lists in the "Administration". Adds button to create bulk operations.
fix
	Entering a transaction with a date before 1/1/1970 caused errors.
	The filter was never saved when the data were not recorded before closing Yapbam's window.
	Importing an empty file caused an error.
	Click a help button caused a crash if java was unable to open a web browser.

version	0.9.6 (10/23/2011)
fix
	Displaying the balance history of an account that a null initial balance and all its transaction's amount null resulted in an error.
	In the wizard for entering sub-transactions: Select a wording that does not appeared in any transaction of the account of the edited transaction caused the wizard to crash.

version	0.9.5 (10/16/2011)
improvement
	Safeguarding the filter between two Yapbam launches is available again for encrypted data files.
	Added specific error messages on backup failure of the preferences or of startup state.
fix
	Under Windows, when the files in the data directory were hidden, the state and/or preferences were not saved. Similarly, the currency converter didn't work.

version	0.9.4 (10/02/2011)
fix
	The export crashed when "comment" was in the exported fields.
	Closing Yapbam under Java 1.7:  didn't exit the java virtual machine process.

version	0.9.3 (09/25/2011)
fix
	In countries where the thousands separator is the point (Belgium, for example), when entering an amount without a currency unit (eg 5,25), this number was transformed into a different number (eg 525,00&nbsp;&euro;).
	In "Statements" tab: When opening multiple accounts while running Yapbam, editing transactions resulted in the appearance of the edit dialog of the transaction several times.

version	0.9.2 (09/18/2011)
fix
	Since the 0.9.0 version, when Yapbam was configured to remember the filter and the opened file between two launches, and Yapbam is closed with a password protected file opened, Yapbam was unable to start again. The only way to restart Yabam was to erase the line starting with "filter" in Data/.yapbam file.<br/> In order to fix this major problem as fast as possible, and as it is caused by a misconception of the filter backup, the filter backup is deactivated in this release when using password protected file.
	In importation: When the imported file contained invalid lines and the last column of the file wasn't attached to a transaction attribute, the importation failed.

version	0.9.1 (09/16/2011)
fix
	Exportation was impossible if a previous exportation has been made in a previous Yapbam version.
	In the payment mode dialog, the "validate" button was not always disabled when some fields were empty. Validating such a dialog caused an error.

	The filter can be remembered between two launches.

fix
	In the import process: When there were missing columns at the end of imported lines, the import failed.
	When, in the transaction input dialog, you chose a predefined label with the date field empty, the error dialog signaled a program error.
	The mode creation dialog allowed the user to check the "use a checkbook" box then to uncheck the "Usable for expenses" box. Validating such a dialog caused an error.
	In the subtransaction edition dialog: When you chose a description in the popup menu by clicking on it with the mouse, the description appeared in the field (this is the normal behavior). But, when validating the input, the description saved was the one before selecting the predefined description !
	Entering an invalid regular expression in the "custom filter" dialog caused an error when validating the dialog.

version	0.8.8 (08/03/2011)

	In the import process: When a the imported file contained invalid values and has more than none columns, the import failed.

version	0.8.7 (07/23/2011)
improvement
	The "customized filter" dialog is smaller and now compatible will 768px height screens.
fix
	In some dialogs:<ul><li>The cancel button in the category dialog and the account dialog confirmed the dialog (same action as ok !).</li><li>In some dialogs, typing a wrong value didn't prevent you from validate the dialog if you clicked very, very, very quickly the ok button.</li></ul>
	In the administration tab:<ul><li>"Delete", "Duplicate" and "Edit" buttons were not grayed out when no data was selected. Sometimes it could cause crashes.</li><li>Deleting the content of the "initial balance" cell of an account in the accounts table caused a crash.</li></ul>
	In transaction dialog, checking the receipt box when amount field was empty caused a crash.
	In the "customized filters" dialog: The "Clear all filters" button didn't erase the filter based on the receipt/expense nature of the transaction.

	In password protection: The password protection was cleared every time the file was saved again.
	The help on Linux was broken.
	Selecting an item in the contextual menu on a chart in statistics tab resulted in an error.
