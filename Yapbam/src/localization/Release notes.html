<h1>Version 0.3.8 (12/??/2009)</h1>
<p>This version is a prerelease with some missing functionnalities
and, probably, some bugs.<br>
You will also find some GUI items without any
tooltip.<br>
<br>
Nevertheless it's already useful to manage your bank accounts (I&nbsp;use
it for my own). Feel free to report any bug.<br>
</p>
<p>The next functionnalities I plan to add :
</p>
<ul><li>Something
to edit payment modes ... (currently, you can add or remove them, but not
edit). For now, you have to manually edit
the XML file ... at your own risks.</li><li>The ability to compress and encrypt data files and store them over the Internet.</li><li>An auto-complete wizard in the "new transaction"
dialog that would be able to complete the description as you type and
to deduce other informations (especially categories).</li><li>Maybe the ability to deal with OFX data files ... If a lot of users ask for it.</li></ul>
<h2>New in this version</h2>
<ul><li><span class="bugFix"></span><span class="bugFix"></span>Introduce better filtering capabilities (on category, modes, etc ...)..</li>
</ul>
