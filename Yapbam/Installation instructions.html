<h1>Installation instructions </h1>
<ol>
  <li><strong>You need to have a java 5 (or more) runtime installed</strong>. 
    <br>
    Under Windows, a simple way to have it is to download and install the package 
    provided by Sun (<a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads">http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads</a>).<br>
    <br>
    Under Linux, the best way is to use the package management tool.<br>
    For instance, for Ubuntu type the following command in a console window :<br>
    sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jre.</li>
  <li><strong>Copy the yapbam.jar file ... where you want on your hard disk</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Double-click on the yapbam.jar</strong> ... it should launch YAPBAM<br>
    It is possible that the OS launch another application ... for instance an 
    archive manager. A right click &quot;launch with Java SE&quot; (the exact 
    wording may depends on your environment), will solve the problem.<br>
    Note : It's ok, this is ugly !!! In a future release, I will probably try 
    to solve this with a small piece of C code.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Uninstall YAPBAM</h1>
<p>Delete yapbam.jar file and the hidden file .yapbam (it contains the preferences) 
  ... and, if you really want ... your data files.</p>
