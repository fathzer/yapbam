<h2> Automatic backups</h2>
<p>Backup your data is essential to ensure their safety.</p>
<p>Yapbam allows you to make a compressed copy of each file read on a storage 
  medium (flash drive, internal or external disk) on your computer, or through 
  ftp, on a file server.</p>
<p>This second solution is recommended, especially if the server is located in 
  a place other than your computer (in case of fire or flood, is the only way 
  to save your data).</p>
<p>Most operators provide Internet access to an FTP server.<br>
  Visit your their support pages or your favorite search engine to learn more.</p>
