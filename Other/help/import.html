<h2>Import</h2>
<p>Yapbam allows you to import data saved in text format with another
account manager or in a spreasheet (like Excel or Open Office).</p><h3><span class="mw-headline">How Yapbam detects transactions, subtransactions and account's initial balance : </span></h3><ul><li>A line containing a value in the date column is always considered as a transaction.</li><li>Other
lines are subtransactions, if they are after a transaction, or an
account initial balance if are located before any transaction.</li><li>If the account column of a "initial balance" line is empty, the balance is attached to the default account.</li><li>If an account has many "initial balance" lines, the initial balance will be the sum of these lines.</li></ul><h3>Dates format :</h3>The date format depends on&nbsp;Yapbam language and country.<br>This format is the "short" standard date format. For instance, in US, dates have the format "MM/DD/AA"
<h3>Amounts format :</h3>The amount format depends on&nbsp;Yapbam language and country.<br>The default separator between integer and decimal part of the amount is, for instance, the point in US and a comma in France. It can be replaced by a custom separator.<br>Yapbam accepts that currency symbol is included or not in amount fields.<br></body></html>
