<h1>Version &nbsp;0.1.12 (in progress)</h1>
<p>This version is a preview with a lot of missing
functionnalities and
probably
a lot of bugs.<br>
You will also find a lot of GUI items without any
tooltip.<br>
<br>
Nevertheless it's already useful to manage some bank account (I
currently use
it for my own). Feel free to report any bug. Please be indulgent, it's
still a preview ;-) <br>
</p>
The next functionnalities I hope to add :
<ol>
<li>The ability to manage periodic transactions.</li>
<li>Something to manage accounts, category ... (currently, you
can add them, but not edit or remove what you've added). For now, you
have to manually edit the XML file ... at your own risks.</li>
<li>Some statistics or charts about categories.</li>
<li>Maybe - The ability to compress and encrypt data files.</li>
<li>Maybe - An auto-complete wizard in the "new transaction"
dialog that would be able to complete the description as you type and
to deduce other informations (especially categories).</li>
</ol>
<h2>New in this version</h2><ul><li>Add a Preference MenuItem in the main menu bar.</li></ul>
