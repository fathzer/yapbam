<h1>Version &nbsp;0.1.14 (13/09/2009)</h1>
<p>This version is a preview with somme missing functionnalities
and, probably, a lot of bugs.<br>
You will also find a lot of GUI items without any
tooltip.<br>
<br>
Nevertheless it's already useful to manage some bank account (I
currently use
it for my own). Feel free to report any bug. Please be indulgent, it's
still a preview ;-) <br>
</p>
<p>The next functionnalities I hope to add :
</p>
<ol>
<li>The ability to define and manage periodic transactions.</li>
<li>Something
to manage accounts, category ... (currently, you can add them, but not
edit or remove what you've added). For now, you have to manually edit
the XML file ... at your own risks.</li>
<li>Some statistics or charts about categories.</li>
<li>Maybe - The ability to compress and encrypt data files.</li>
<li>Maybe - An auto-complete wizard in the "new transaction"
dialog that would be able to complete the description as you type and
to deduce other informations (especially categories).</li>
</ol>
<h2>New in this version</h2>
<ul>
<li><span class="bugFix">Bug fixed</span> :
When the preferred localization changed, the dates in the transaction
table were still displayed using the initial localization.</li><li>Add a new menu item to check for updates.</li>
</ul>

versions a duplicated transaction could appear far away for its clone).</li>

always reset to the default order, and the saved column size where
applied tothe default column order ... which could be considered as a
bug).</li>
