<h1>How to install Yapbam ?</h1>
<h2>Windows OS:</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Extract the content of yapbam.zip file ... to
a new&nbsp;folder where you want
on your hard disk, or on an USB key</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Double-click on the yapbam application</strong>.<br>
If a window appears with the message "This application requires a Java
Runtime Environment 1.6.0", it means you have to install the Java
Runtime Environment.<br>
The simplest way to do it is to click the ok button: You will be
redirected to the Java download page. Download&nbsp;and install the
suggested
package. Then launch Yapbam again.<br>
If you can't access to the Java download page (if you're currently not
connected to the Internet), you can get it later at this
address:&nbsp;<a href="http://java.com/download">http://java.com/download</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Others OS:</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Extract the content of yapbam.zip file ...
to
a new&nbsp;folder where you want
on your hard disk, or on an USB key</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Double-click on the yapbam.jar</strong>
file ... it should launch YAPBAM</li>
<li><strong>What to do
if it fails ?</strong>
<ol>
<li>Ensure that you have Java installed on your computer.<br>
Under linux a simple way is to launch a terminal then type the command:<br>
<pre> java -version</pre>
If the command fails or if it reports a version older than 1.6.0,
please install the latest java version with the command:<br>
<pre>sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jre.</pre>
</li>
<li>It is possible that the OS launch another application
... for instance
an archive manager. A right click may show a "launch with Java SE" (the exact
wording may depends on your environment) menu that will solve the problem.</li>
