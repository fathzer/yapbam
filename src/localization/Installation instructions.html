<h1>Installation instructions </h1>
<ol>
<li><strong>You need to have a java 6 (or more) runtime
installed</strong>. <br>
Under Windows, a simple way to have it is to download and install the
package provided by Sun (<a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads">http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads</a>).<br>
<br>
Under Linux, the best way is to use the package management tool.<br>
For instance, for Ubuntu type the following command in a console window
:<br>
sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jre.</li>
<p>You may also have openJDK already installed with your Linux
distribution. Yapbam is, of course, compatible with this Java Virtual
Machine.</p>
<li><strong>Extract the content of yapbam.zip file ... to
a new created folder where you want
on your hard disk, or on an USB key</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Double-click on the yapbam.jar</strong>
... it should launch YAPBAM<br>
It is possible that the OS launch another application ... for instance
an archive manager. A right click "launch with Java SE" (the exact
wording may depends on your environment), will solve the problem.<br>If you're on windows, double click on yapbam.bat, it should solve the problem.<br>
Note : It's ok, this is ugly !!! In a future release, I will probably
try to solve this with a small piece of C code.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Upgrading Yapbam</h1>
<ol>
<li>Quit Yapbam.</li>
<li>Extract the content of the zip file to the Yapbam folder
(the one you've create when you installed Yapbam).</li>
<li>Restart Yapbam.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Uninstall Yapbam</h1>
<ul>
<li>Delete the Yapbam folder.<br>
Be aware that Yapbam maintains two hidden files in its folder
:&nbsp;.yapbam (which
contains the yapbam startup state) and .yapbampref (it contains the
preferences). Deleting only the files you see in the folder will be not
enough, you have to delete the folder.</li>
<li> ... and, if you really want ... your data files.</li>
</ul>
